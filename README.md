# Bank-Dataset

- Created a Bank Management System which has Multiple tables and
relationships between the tables depending on the constraints 
passing to connect the different tables. By using this database
the information of particular customers and employees who are working in
the bank can be retrieved. In this database, also created a view for a customer and the
employees in the bank.

- The Bank wants to build the database for their customer and employees with
all the details like creating an account in a bank type of account which helps
the bank to retrieve the data on one click so they can find out the day to day
update easily on their database.
In this project, I have build the database from scratch in SQL. Solved few queries in the end for the bank.
